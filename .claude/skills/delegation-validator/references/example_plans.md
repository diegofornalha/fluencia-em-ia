## Example 1: Excellent Lesson (Score: 9.3/10)

### Lesson Plan: "Strategic AI Planning for Research"

**Objective:** Students will learn to make strategic decisions about when, how, and why to use AI in academic research.

#### Part 1: Problem Awareness (Score: 10/10)

**Activity 1: The "Should I?" Framework**
Before using ANY AI tool, answer these 3 questions:
1. What am I trying to accomplish? (Define objective clearly)
2. Is this task appropriate for AI collaboration? (Question IF)
3. Which interaction mode fits: Automation, Augmentation, or Agency?

**Exercise:** Students analyze 5 research scenarios:
- Literature review → Augmentation (AI finds, human evaluates)
- Bibliography formatting → Automation (AI formats, human verifies)
- Thesis argument → Human only (critical thinking required)
- Survey design → Augmentation (AI suggests, human decides)
- Data collection → Depends on context (discuss trade-offs)

✅ **Why 10/10:**
- Explicitly teaches "Should I use AI?" question
- Decision framework for appropriateness
- All 3 modes covered with examples
- Includes scenarios where AI is NOT appropriate

---

#### Part 2: Platform Awareness (Score: 9/10)

**Activity 2: AI Tool Comparison Lab**
Students test the same research question on 3 tools:
- ChatGPT (general purpose)
- Perplexity (research-focused)
- Claude (long-context analysis)

**Comparison Matrix:**
| Tool | Strengths | Limitations | Best For |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| ChatGPT | Fast, conversational | May hallucinate sources | Quick brainstorming |
| Perplexity | Cites sources | Limited analysis depth | Initial research |
| Claude | Deep analysis | Slower | Complex text analysis |

**Discussion:** Privacy considerations - which tools store your data?

✅ **Why 9/10:**
- Compares 3 tools with hands-on testing
- Discusses capabilities AND limitations
- Includes privacy considerations
- Missing: ethical considerations beyond privacy (could reach 10/10)

---

#### Part 3: Task Delegation (Score: 9/10)

**Activity 3: Research Workflow Design**
Students create delegation plan for research paper:

**Good Delegation Example:**
1. AI: Generate 10 research questions (Automation)
2. Human: Select 3 most relevant (Critical thinking)
3. AI: Find 20 sources per question (Automation)
4. Human: Read abstracts, select 5 best sources (Evaluation)
5. AI: Summarize selected papers (Augmentation)
6. Human: Synthesize insights, form argument (Critical thinking)
7. AI: Suggest structure (Augmentation)
8. Human: Write with unique analysis (Creativity)

**Bad Delegation Example:**
1. AI: Write entire research paper
2. Human: Submit without reading

**Why bad?** No critical thinking, no learning, academic dishonesty

**Exercise:** Students design delegation for own research project, justify each choice.

✅ **Why 9/10:**
- Specific workflow strategies
- Good vs bad examples with justifications
- Students practice with own projects
- Missing: what to do when strategy fails (could reach 10/10)

---

**Overall: 9.3/10 - Excellent, ready to pilot**

## Example 2: Good Lesson (Score: 7.0/10)

### Lesson Plan: "Using AI for Writing"

#### Part 1: Problem Awareness (Score: 7/10)

**Introduction:**
"Today we'll learn to use AI to help with writing. First, define your writing goal clearly."

**Activity:** Students write down:
- What type of document (essay, report, email)
- Target audience
- Main message

**Discussion:** When is AI helpful for writing vs when should you write yourself?
- AI can help with: brainstorming, outlines, grammar
- You should do: original thinking, personal voice, final editing

✅ **Why 7/10:**
- Teaches objective-setting
- Discusses when to use AI vs not
- Missing: interaction modes (automation vs augmentation)
- Missing: structured framework

---

#### Part 2: Platform Awareness (Score: 6/10)

**Tool Overview:**
We'll use ChatGPT and Claude in this class.

**ChatGPT** is good for quick brainstorming.
**Claude** is better for longer documents.

**Reminder:** AI can make mistakes. Always fact-check.

⚠️ **Why 6/10:**
- Mentions 2 tools
- Brief comparison
- Mentions limitations (mistakes)
- Missing: hands-on comparison
- Missing: ethical/privacy considerations

---

#### Part 3: Task Delegation (Score: 8/10)

**Writing Workflow:**
1. Use AI to brainstorm topics
2. You choose the best topic
3. Use AI to create outline
4. You write the first draft using your own words
5. Use AI to check grammar
6. You do final revisions

**Important:** The thinking and writing must be yours!

✅ **Why 8/10:**
- Clear workflow with human/AI division
- Emphasizes human responsibility (thinking, writing)
- Missing: examples of good vs bad delegation
- Missing: alternative strategies

---

**Overall: 7.0/10 - Good, minor improvements needed**

**Recommendations:**
- Add structured framework for Problem Awareness
- Expand Platform Awareness with hands-on tool testing
- Add examples of good vs bad delegation in Task Delegation

---

## Example 3: Adequate Lesson (Score: 5.0/10)

## Using These Examples

### For Self-Assessment:
1. Read examples at different score levels
2. Find which one your lesson most resembles
3. Identify specific elements to add from higher-scoring examples

### For Improvement:
1. Start with adequate example
2. Add ONE element from good example
3. Test with students
4. Iterate toward excellent

### For Validation:
- Don't aim for 10/10 immediately
- 7+ is strong enough to pilot
- Use student feedback to refine
- Perfect is enemy of good
